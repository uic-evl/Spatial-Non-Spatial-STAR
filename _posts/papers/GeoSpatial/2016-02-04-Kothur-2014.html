categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geospatial Fields
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper describes a Visual Analytic tool to compare ocean models: the only way to asses the quality of an oceanographic model is to compare it with other models or with observation.
Comparing such a great volume of data is difficult, this tool solves it by clustering the data using parameters given by the user and then plotting these clusters in two side by side visualization where the user can see similarities and differences.
