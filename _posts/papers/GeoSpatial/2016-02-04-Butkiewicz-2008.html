summary: "This paper introduces the concept of probes in geospatial analysis: comparing data about particular regions that are spatially distant is really challenging using the usual spatial visualizations. In order to see both of the regions the zoom level should be reduced, making it impossible for the user to see interesting patterns. A probe is an independent visualization of a single region, that can be put side by side with another probe in order to compare local patterns in very distant regions. "
