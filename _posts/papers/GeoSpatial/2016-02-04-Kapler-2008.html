title: 'Configurable Spaces: Temporal Analysis in Diagrammatic Contexts'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper introduces geotime, a system for analysis of events and transaction in time and space. The novel idea is to overlay the flow of events over a map, while the time component is plotted on the third dimension as a height over the map. The system also utilizes linked views to show additional details on some part of the flow, that may have been abstracted on the map."
