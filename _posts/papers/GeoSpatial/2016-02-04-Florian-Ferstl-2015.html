title: 'Streamline Variability Plots for Characterizing the Uncertainty in Vector Field Ensembles'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays
summary: "This paper presents a new method to visualize ensembles of flow field: the flow is first reduced to a low-dimensional Euclidean field by applying a principal component analysis, it is then clustered and represented as a combination of its major trends. The result is a schematic overview of the analyzed flow."
