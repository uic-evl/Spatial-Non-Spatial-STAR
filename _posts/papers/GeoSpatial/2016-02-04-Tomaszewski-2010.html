summary: "This paper proposes a visualization that helps the user making important decisions, by trying to construct what they call a geo-historical context around the decision to be made. The decisions considered here are of crisis management and humanitarian reliefs, the way in which they try to provide the geo-historical context is through documents foraging. Linked views are used to show documents related to the selected region of a map. Searches can be made without leaving the context. Links to other regions with similar problems are shown on the map.
