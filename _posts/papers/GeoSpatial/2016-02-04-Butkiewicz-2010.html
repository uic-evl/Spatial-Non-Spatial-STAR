title: 'Alleviating The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem within Probe-Based Geospatial Analyses'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper presents a probe-based visualization for urban growth data. The focus of the visualization is the comparison between areas that can be selected on a map. the comparison can be made using the graphs that are linked to the main view. The novel method presented is a solution to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem: when the user tries to compare very different areas, the system alerts him and, through the use of some semi-automated tools, helps him correcting the selected regions in order to make a fair comparison."
