summary: "The paper is part of the VAST 2011 Epidemic spread challenge. ScatterBlogs tries to talk the challenge using a novel combination of visualizations: the tag clouds are overlaid on the map, giving a pretty good overview of the situation. Interesting is also the use of colors to encode the time in the visualization."
