summary: "This paper presents an interactive visualization to help meteorologists to make good short term predictions. The meteorological model's output is strictly numerical, and a visualization is needed in order to make it understandable. The visualization presented here introduces new tools to help the user, such as a curve-pattern selector, spatial Ô¨Ålters, and a linked meteogram.
