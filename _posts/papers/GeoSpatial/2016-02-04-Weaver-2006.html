dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper describes a tool to visualize hotel visitation patterns. The tool make use of linked views, the spatial part of the data is visualized using a map with overlays: trajectories from the home of people visiting the hotel are drawn. Then a matrix chart displays the visitors as in a calendar, where every single visitor has a number assigned. An arc chart helps the user to understand temporal relationship between recurrent visits of the same customer, even if they are distant in time. Tables showing the raw dataset are linked to the other views through brushing."
