title: 'A Visual Analytics System for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting-based Localization'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Spatial Fields
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper proposes a visualization tool intended to help the user choose the proper fingerprints to use for indoor radio frequency based localization. The visualization is composed by a map, on which are spatially overlaid the strength of each detected radio signal. Once a fingerprint is chosen using the linked tables, the system performs a classification simulation and shows which areas are misclassified. A parallel coordinates graph is also linked to the view, to show the temporal and spatial stability of given feature values."
