title: 'Geographically Weighted Visualization: Interactive Graphics for Scale-Varying Exploratory Analysis'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: GeoSpatial Fields
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper proposes a series of novel visualizations to help the user compare demographic variables between different regions. Linked views are used side by side with an heatmap to provide more informations. Box plots are used to show how a selected region is doing with respect to the others. All the statistics are weighted also with respect to the geographic distance of regions, so to highlight possible patterns that couldnâ€™t be seen otherwise. A novel visualization is utilized: a scalogram is designed to help explore variations and the geographical scales at which they occur."
