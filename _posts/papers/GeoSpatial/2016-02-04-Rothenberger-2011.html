summary: "The visualization created in this paper helps the user to analyze the correlation in county level gun/homicide data. A novel visualization consists in overlaying 2D pexels over a map: the orientation, color, and size of the pexel represent laws, poverty percentage, and homicide rate. This gives the user a nice overview of the causes of a high or low homicide rate.
