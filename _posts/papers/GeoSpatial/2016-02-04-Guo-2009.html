title: 'Flow Mapping and Multivariate Visualization of Large Spatial Interaction Data'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper proposes an effective interface to analyze migrations flows. Dealing with migration flows is hard because of the countless number of variables associated with a single flow, such as migrant’s age, origin, volume… The visualization proposed makes a wise use of linked views to show all of this attributes to the user without losing his spatial awareness thanks to the always present map.
