summary: "This paper proposes a novel visualization for quantitative data about geographic regions : the Necklace Maps. This visualization completely erases the bias towards small regions, giving them a symbol with a size related to their quantitative data. All the region symbols are projected onto intervals on a one-dimensional curve (the necklace) that surrounds the map regions. The major flaw of this visualization is that the spatial and topographic relationships are completely lost."
