summary: "This paper proposes a visualization suite to support the emergency evacuation of people from disaster areas. A stacked bar chart is used to display the evacuation situation over time, a map reports the nearest vehicles suitable to evacuate different people with different needs. A Gantt chart is used to display an evacuation overview over the time, and lastly a matrix visualization is used to see the number of trips between pairs of locations. The tool also automatically calculates a suitable plan using genetic algorithms, the fine tuning and confirmation are left to the user."
