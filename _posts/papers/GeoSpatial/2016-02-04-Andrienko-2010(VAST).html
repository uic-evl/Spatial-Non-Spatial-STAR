title: "Discovering Bits of Place Histories from People's Activity Traces."
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper proposes a series of visual analytics methods to discover important events from activity traces such as geotagged photos or phone calls. Using statistical methods is easy to find exceptional patterns in this type of data: if there are way more phones than usual in a specific region that means some sort of event is going on there. These statistical anomalies are then overlaid over a map to show them spatially. Through the use of linked views more detailed line charts are linked to the map, showing the data in detail."
