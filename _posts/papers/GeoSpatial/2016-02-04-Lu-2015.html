categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "A lot of work has been done lately about retrieving informations about events using online media, this paper goes beyond that: it detects shifts in the topic of the overall media discourse. Once a shift in the discussion is found it helps the analyst to find what event (if any) caused it. The use of linked views gives a complete overview of all the possible causes that could have triggered such a change. As a case study they explored the relationship between climate change and conflicts in Africa."
