categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "This paper proposes a visualization tool to visualize self-organizing network data related to cellular cells and neighbor cell relations. The visualization uses both linked views and overlays. A main map is overlaid with 3 different layers: colors, symbols and glyphs. The map is then surrounded by other views: a relation based parallel coordinates chart, a time slider, and two line charts that provide informations about the selected cell."
