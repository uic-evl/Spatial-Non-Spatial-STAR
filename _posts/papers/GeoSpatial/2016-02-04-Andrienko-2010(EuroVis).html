Exploring Spatiotemporal Patterns'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geospatial Fields
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: 'This paper proposes a visualization tool to help exploring spatial attributes changing over time. The result is achieved through the use of linked views in combination with overlays on maps and through a method called "Self-Organizing Map". The main visualization is composed by two maps with overlays: the first one shows space-in-time SOM (grouping of spatial situations) while the second one shows a time-in-space SOM. The comparison between these two visualizations helps the user to discover interesting patterns. Other visualizations and more detailed SOM can be visualized as details on demand.'
