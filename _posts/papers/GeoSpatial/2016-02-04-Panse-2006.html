title: 'Visualization of Geo-spatial Point Sets via Global Shape Transformation and Local Pixel Placement'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays
summary: "This paper presents a combination of cartograms-based layouts and pixel local placement to produce a cartogram. This combination produces cartograms that manage to show interesting patterns at local level while preserving the overall shape of the original map, making the user life easier."
