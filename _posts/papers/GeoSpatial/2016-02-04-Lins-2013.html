title: 'Nanocubes for Real-Time Exploration of Spatiotemporal Datasets'
categories: GeoSpatial
dataType: Geometry
typeEnc: Overlays/Linked Views
summary: "Lins et al. present a novel data structure called nanocube for the exploration of large multidimensional spatiotemporal datasets. They also build linked and brushable visual encodings, such as heatmaps, histograms, and parallel coordinate plots. They test their method on six datasets from different domains.
