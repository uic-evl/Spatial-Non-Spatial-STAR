The user can see where the birds are over time while a number of nonspatial information about the region are shown. This visualization can also be useful to find environmental changes in particular regions.

It is composed by 3 linked views: A cluster graph groups the analysis station by similarity, a map shows their spatial location, and, once the user select a set of stations, a graph shows the temporal dimension of the data.

They also build linked and brushable visual encodings, such as heatmaps, histograms, and parallel coordinate plots. They test their method on six datasets from different domains.
